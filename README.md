Feasibility Study of Project

What Is a Feasibility Study?

Feasibility study is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed plan or project. A feasibility study analyses the viability of a project to determine whether the project or venture is likely to succeed. The study is also designed to identify potential issues and problems that could arise from pursuing the project.
As part of the feasibility study, project managers must determine whether they have enough people, financial resources, and the appropriate technology. The study must also determine the return on investment, whether it's measured as a financial gain or a benefit to society, as in the case of a non-profit.

Whether a project is feasible or not can depend following factors:

1.What is Multipurpose Security System?

A Multipurpose security system provides the results of some important parameters like theft prevention from the homes, offices or shops etc. A Multipurpose security system can be achieved by designing an application through various sensors such as motion sensor- PIR sensor, motion sensor, light sensor and microphones. If any of the sensors detects uneven activities alert and also SMS is sent to the house owner through mobile app.

2.How it will work?

•	Passive infrared (PIR) sensors use a pair of pyro electric sensors to detect heat energy in the surrounding environment. 

•	A motion sensor, or motion detector, is an electronic device that uses a sensor to detect nearby people or objects.

•	Light sensors detect light and convert light energy to an electrical signal output. The LDR Sensor is used to detect the presence of light / measuring the intensity of light.

•	Capacitive MEMS microphones work by measuring the capacitance between a flexible micro-scale membrane and a fixed backplate.

•	Collected data from the sensors sent to the cloud for further analysis.

3.How product will be built?

4.What is the reason for building the product?

With the increasing rate of crime, protecting our loved ones and our belongings has become important. Home is the place where we feel the most secure. But with the rise in crime, it has immiscibly important to guard our homes at all the times especially when we asleep or away.


5.What will customer gain from product?

Customer will be used this product in many fields like in home, office, shops, indoor, outdoor or anywhere. It protects any part of your home even, your background. This secures any of your belongings from our expensive tech gadgets to your drawers and safety locks. Most important it is a low cost, portable and stand-alone device which saves money.
